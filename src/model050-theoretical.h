 *
 *  Description:    Simulates ensembles of multiple species responding to 
 *                  partially shared stochastic environmental variation.
 *
 *  Project Structure:  
 *      1. model        
 *              The full simulation model        
 *      2. model050     
 *              Estimates the limits of degree of sharing (rho^2) above which
 *              correlations with aggregate abundance exceed R^2=50%.
 *      3. model050-theoretical
 *              As for model050, but using analytic expresssions for species
 *              interactions only, neglecting other effects.
 *      4. model-envcor
 *              Examines additional effects of (i) correlations between
 *              otherwise independent parts of each species' environmental
 *              variation, and (ii) correlations between interaction strengths
 *              and degrees of environmental sharing.
 *      5. trophic-levels
 *              Separate routine to estimate number of equivalent trophic levels
 *              from random community matrices.
 *
 *  Limitations:
 *
 *  Dependencies:       libboost
 *
 *  Compiler Options:   -std=c++11 -lboost_program_options
